BPOW was an Interactive Electronic Arts Festival in Portland, Oregon dedicated to the art of salvaged sound. 
Encompassing a full weekend of workshops, performances and culminating in a DIY public jam session, BPOW!!! wants to show Portland that even the simplest circuit configurations can bring forth unprecedented levels of ROCK.
